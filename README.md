# Nonsmooth Analysis course project

My presentation on the Moreau's sweeping process that I had done as a part of my Nonsmooth Analysis in Control and Optimization (EE6431) coursework in the Jan.-May 
2025 semester.

[Presentation PDF](ee6431_Presentation.pdf) - slide number 35 inclues an animation of the sweeping process. To view the animation, use a PDF reader that renders animations, such as Adobe PDF reader.
